# Black Ops 2 Zombies - Super Easter Egg With Any Player Amount

This mod makes the super easter egg on Buried accessible with any amount of players.
Every player still needs to complete the required easter eggs (Tranzit, Die Rise, Buried) and have the navcards unlocked.
Code is based on the decompiled treyarch-script taken from here:
